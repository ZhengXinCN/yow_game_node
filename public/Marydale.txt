Many thanks for purchasing Marydaleª, a member of 3IPÕs growing type library. We appreciate your business very much.

As a casual handlettering face, Marydaleª works well in diagram legends, cutlines or other display situations, or when used to mimic informal hand-lettering Ñ as on sticky notes. Some prefer its uppercase characters and routinely use all caps. Marydaleª comes in three styles: Regular, Bold, and Black. Each comes with a full character set, along with a scattering of special characters. Please see the enclosed key chart for details.

Use of Marydaleª is restricted by the 3IP End User License Agreement (EULA), below.

If youÕre interested in viewing other typefaces in the Three Islands Press library, check out 3IPÕs digital foundry on the Web, The Type Quarry:
