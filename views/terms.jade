            | ThoughtWorkers are passionate about technology. We build it, research it, test it, open source it, write about it, and 
            | constantly aim to improve it â€“ for everyone. Our mission is to champion software excellence and revolutionize IT. We 
            | create and share the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar in support of that mission. The ThoughtWorks Technology Advisory 
            | Board, a group of senior technology leaders in ThoughtWorks, creates the radar. They meet regularly to discuss the 
            | global technology strategy for ThoughtWorks and the technology trends that significantly impact our industry.

            | The radar captures the output of the boards discussions in a format that provides value to a wide range of 
            | stakeholders, from CIOs to developers. The content is intended as a concise summary. We encourage you to explore these technologies 
            | for more detail. The radar is graphical in nature, grouping items into techniques, tools, platforms, and languages & frameworks. When 
            | radar items could appear in multiple quadrants, we chose the one that seemed most appropriate. We further group these items in four 
            | rings to reflect our current position on them. The rings are:



          ul
            li
              strong Adopt&nbsp;
              | - We feel strongly that the industry should be adopting these items. We use them when appropriate on our projects
            li
              strong Trial&nbsp;
              | - Worth pursuing. It is important to understand how to build up this capability. Enterprises should try this technology 
              | on a project that can handle the risk
            li 
              strong Assess&nbsp;
              | - Worth exploring with the goal of understanding how it will affect your enterprise
            li
              strong Hold&nbsp;
              | - Proceed with caution
